# Plan 4: Layout and Routing

## Goal
Create the basic application structure and navigation.

## Tasks
1.  Create a `Layout` component (or modify `src/app/layout.tsx`) to include:
    -   **Navbar**: Logo, Title ("Global Speed Test Map").
    -   **Footer**: Links to Privacy Policy, FAQ.
2.  Create the main page routes:
    -   `src/app/page.tsx`: The Homepage / Speed Test page.
    -   `src/app/map/page.tsx`: The Map visualization page.
    -   `src/app/privacy/page.tsx`: A placeholder for the Privacy Policy.
3.  Add basic responsive styling to the Layout using Tailwind CSS.

## Verification
-   Navigate to `/` and verify the layout renders.
-   Navigate to `/map` and verify the route works.
-   Navigate to `/privacy` and verify the route works.
